# E-Commerce Dashboard Implementation Walkthrough

I've successfully built an aesthetic and fully functional E-Commerce dashboard according to your requirements using React and the newly released Tailwind CSS v4.

## Key Features Implemented

- **App Scaffolding & Setup**: Created a highly performant Vite + React setup, successfully integrating modern Tailwind CSS v4 configurations.
- **Premium Core Layout**: Crafted a beautiful layout containing a persistent sidebar and top navigation header. The designs utilize subtle shadows, gradients, and rounded aesthetic cues for a premium feel.
- **Dashboard Overview**: Developed the main entry page with dynamic, engaging metric cards (Total Revenue, Stock, Customers, and Active Products).
- **Product Management (CRUD)**: 
  - **Read**: A styled and responsive data table listing products.
  - **Create/Update**: A well-designed modal form capturing Product Name, Price, Stock, Category, and an Image URL field to cleanly add or edit items.
  - **Delete**: Quick actions to seamlessly remove elements from the layout.
- **Global State Management**: Set up a React Context API provider to allow state sharing across the Overview and Product management screens instantly.

## Verification

I fired up a browser subagent which navigated into the live local instance to verify that routing and rendering work. It clicked precisely into the Products page, ensuring the router context responds correctly.

Here is a quick snapshot captured of the beautifully styled Dashboard Overview:

And here is the complete recording of the subagent interacting with the site:
